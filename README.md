2048

Clone of the 2048 Game

Built with native Objective-C for iOS 7, doesn't use any gaming framework 
Integrates with Flurry and Chartboost (check saAppDelegate.m file to set the IDs)

This is a first version with a lot of room for improvement, specially in the tiles position calculation, so it can work seamlessly in other screen sizes

Game can be found at the app store - https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/2048-power-of-2/id866172644?mt=8
